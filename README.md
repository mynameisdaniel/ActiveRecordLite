# Active Record Lite!

How does Active Record really work? How does Active Record automagically fetch associations? It is smart enough to know the plural of human is humans and not humens? 

Our first meta-programming project. The skeleton and initial database queries are provided by the AppAcademy Staff. We write the rest!

Major aspects of thie project:
* Getter and Setter methods
* SQL Queries
* Associations: Has_many, belongs_to


Instructions for the project may be found [here][instructions].
